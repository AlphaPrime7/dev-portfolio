# ## NodeJS KickOff
- - - Part of the nodejs curriculum for me.
- - - I have maintained and hold total conviction that you can only learn programming by being laser focused on projects then trust the process that accomplishing or completing projects will build up into solving harder problems.
- - - Based on the statement above, the dev portfolio is my first step into the world of JS, Reactive HTML (similar to R reactive shiny apps), nodejs (npm builds is what i mean), looking into nextjs or next builds (based on the inspiration for this project).
  - - I MUST learn this because as of now I stand as the UI, web and every other role of my startup so I need to know enough of these tools to get my MVP up and running then I will work on enlarging the team.
